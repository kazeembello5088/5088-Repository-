AI Tools Assignment: AI Tools and Applications
Theme: "Mastering the AI Toolkit" 🛠️🧠

Objective & Guidelines

This assignment evaluates your understanding of AI tools/frameworks and their real-world applications through a mix of theoretical and practical tasks. You’ll demonstrate proficiency in selecting, implementing, and critically analyzing AI tools to solve problems.

The assignment has three parts: theory, which tests the theoretical understanding of AI Tools; Practical, which tests the implementation skills of AI tools; and Ethics and optimization, which tests ethical AI development and AI software optimization skills. 

The assignment should be handled as group work formed by 3-5 people. This is to enhance teamwork and AI engineering collaboration.

Submission Guidelines

Code: Well-commented scripts/Jupyter notebooks. (To be submitted on GitHub)

Report: A PDF with:

Answers to theoretical questions. 

Screenshots of model outputs (e.g., accuracy graphs, NER results).

Ethical reflection.

(Share this PDF as an article in the Community, Peer Group Review and include it in the GitHub Repo)

Presentation: Create 3-minute video explaining your approach. (All members in the group should participate in the video. Share the video on the Community platform)

Great! To help your group excel in this “AI Tools and Applications” assignment, here’s a recommended structure and checklist:

✅ Assignment Structure Overview
1. Theoretical Section (30%)
Cover key AI tools/frameworks:

TensorFlow vs PyTorch – Compare syntax, flexibility, popularity.

Scikit-learn – Use in classical ML (SVM, Random Forest, etc.).

spaCy – NLP tasks (NER, POS tagging).
Include:

Strengths and weaknesses.

Suitable use cases (healthcare, finance, etc.).

Comparison table of features.

2. Practical Section (40%)
Use at least 2 frameworks in different domains:

Image Classification with TensorFlow/Keras (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR-10).

Text Classification or NER with spaCy.

Regression or Clustering with Scikit-learn.

Deliverables:

Jupyter Notebooks (with markdown + code).

Model training and evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, F1).

Graphs: training curves, confusion matrix.

Screenshots for report.

3. Ethical & Optimization Section (15%)
Ethical Considerations:

Bias in datasets.

Privacy issues.

Fair AI practices.

Optimization:

Perfect! Let's start building your "Mastering the AI Toolkit" assignment project step-by-step. Here's how we can organize your work quickly within the 7-day deadline.

🔧 PROJECT PLAN: “Mastering the AI Toolkit”
🔹 Group Project Theme:
Project Title: AI-Powered Career Path Recommender for African Students
Goal: Use AI to analyze student profiles and recommend optimal career paths (STEM, Arts, Trades) using NLP + ML tools.

✅ PART 1: THEORY SECTION (30%)
We’ll explain and compare the tools:

Tool	Purpose	Example Use Case	Strengths
TensorFlow	Deep learning framework	Image classification (CIFAR-10)	Production-ready, scalable
PyTorch	Dynamic deep learning	NLP classification	Easy debugging, flexible
Scikit-learn	Classical ML models	Career path prediction	Lightweight, good for tabular data
spaCy	NLP toolkit	Text extraction, NER	Fast, easy pipeline use
We will write:

Short explanations (2-3 paragraphs per tool).

Use cases in education, finance, health.

Comparison table and analysis.

✅ I can generate this section for you if you’d like.

✅ PART 2: PRACTICAL SECTION (40%)
💡 Project: Career Path Recommender System
Datasets:

Simulated student profiles (Name, Subjects, Interests, Grades).

Or real datasets from Kaggle’s Student Performance Dataset

Tasks:

Task	Tool	Description
Data Cleaning	Pandas	Handle missing values, formats
Feature Engineering	Scikit-learn	Convert grades and subjects
NLP for Interests	spaCy	Process text: tokenization, NER
Career Prediction Model	Scikit-learn	Train Random Forest / SVM
Dashboard (Optional)	Streamlit	Show output of recommendations
