1.(a) Timely delivery is crucial in software management for these reasons: customer satisfaction, market competitiveness, cost control, resource allocation,contractual obligations, stakeholder confidence, stakeholder confidence, and agile and iterative development.
(b) Project managers  can ensure that deadlines are met through taking these steps: clear planning, realistic scheduling, prioritization, resources management, regular monitoring, effective communication, risk management and scope control.

2(a) Effective cost control contributes to the success of a software Project  for these reasons:
preventing budget overruns, improving profitability, enhancing decision-making, building stake holders confidence, enabling better forecasting, supporting timely delivery, and reducing risk
(b)  Strategies to prevent budget overruns are: accurate budget planning, defining clear project scope, using a contingency fund, tracking expenses regularly, prioritizing features, control change request, allocating resources wisely, regular communication, and reviewing contracts.

3(a) Agile methodologies are iterative and incremental whereas Waterfall methodologies are linear and sequential.;
Planning in Agile methodologies is flexible but is fixed in Waterfall methodologies;
Development phases in Agile methodologies are done in sprints  while they follow a strict order in Waterfall methodologies;
Customer involvement is high in Agile methodologies but low in Waterfall methodologies;
Team collaboration is high in Agile methodologies but is non-existent in Waterfall methodologies.
(b) Main advantages of Agile methodologies are:  flexibility, adaptability, faster delivery, customer involvement, improved quality,  and customer involvement.
Disadvantages of Agile Methodologies are: less predictability, scope creep, requiring active user involvement, limited documentation, and not ideal for all projects
Advantages of Waterfall methodologies are: simplicity and easiness of management, proper documentation. easy to track 
Disadvantages of Waterfall methodologies are: inflexibility , delay in product delivery, late testing.

4(a) Agile is useful for dynamic projects e.g.  ones where flexibility, fast feedback,and early delivery are priorities.
Waterfall is useful for projects with stable, well-defined requirements and where a clear structure is essential.

5(a) Methods for ensuring quality assurance (QA) throughout a software Project  are: defining clear requirements, implementing a QA plan, conducting Regular Code Review, using Automated Testing ,performing Continuous Testing.
(b) Reason for maintaining high standard in software projects are: ensuring product quality, building user trust and satisfaction , reducing long-term costs, improving security, and promoting team accountability 

6(a) Defining a project scope  contributes to successful project planning in these ways: clarifying objectives and scope of the projects, setting clear expectations, identifying  constraints and risks early, guiding resources allocation, and enabling measurable progress.
(b) A Work breakdown Structure (WBS)  means a visual and hierarchical breakdown of a project into small, manageable parts. Also, it organizes total scope of a project  into structured sections- starting from  the overall project goal and breaking it down into deliverables, and work packages.

7(a) Benefits of developing a detailed project schedule are: clear timeline and deadlines, improved resources management, better coordination, early identification of delays, ,and increasing stakeholder management 
(b) Gantt charts assist in detailed project schedule in these ways: visual timelines of tasks, clear task dependencies, projects tracking, resources allocation, and  milestones management 
 
8(a) Core issues that a software aims to address are: problem resolution, process automation, information management, communication gapa, human error reduction, scalability and growth, security and compliance,and user accessibility.
(b) The core issues are important to the target audience for the following reasons: solving real problems, improving efficiency, enhancing accuracy, reducing costs, enabling better communication, providing security and trust, supporting growth, and  enhancing accessibility and convenience.

9.A clear definition of the problem leads to a more effective software solution as it provides a focused understanding of what needs to be solved. When the problem is accurately defined, the development team designs solutions that directly address user needs, avoid unnecessary features, and stay aligned with the project's goals.

10. I would describe my software solution to an audience  y concentrating on the following: simplicity of my communication, value of the software, relevance of the value to the pain point of the target audience, keeping my address as short as possible, using an audio-visual demo,and ending with a call to action.
11. Main features or functionalist that make a software stand out are: user-friendly interface (UI/UX),high performance, customization and flexibility, integration capabilities, robust security, scalability, automation, real-time data and reporting, mobile accessibility, regular updates and support.
12. The available data regarding the market size  and growth potential for my (learning) software in Lagos State, Nigeria is around  eight billion naira(#8, 000,000,000).
13. Understanding market trends help software positioning and development in the following ways: understanding consumer needs and pain points, guiding features prioritization, helping definition of Unique Value Proposition (UVP), information pricing strategy, shaping marketing, reducing risk of obsolescence,etc.
